## Add to Cart App Using Modal (Task-5)

A simple and interactive React application built with Vite that demonstrates adding items to a shopping cart using a modal dialog. This project is part of a task series to practice React components, state management, and UI interactions.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Display a list of products with details like name, price, and image.
- **Add to Cart**: Click a button to open a modal for adding items to the cart.
- **Modal Interaction**: User-friendly modal for confirming additions, with options to adjust quantity.
- **Cart Management**: View added items in the cart, with the ability to remove or update quantities.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Fast Development**: Leverages Vite for quick builds and hot module replacement (HMR).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface with components and hooks.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for logic and interactivity.
- **CSS & TailWind**: For styling the components and modal.
- **ESLint**: For code linting and maintaining code quality.
